## Introduction

League of Legends is one of the most popular games of all time, with millions of players engaging in competitive matches daily. Each game unfolds uniquely, but certain in-game events and conditions can influence how long a match will last. Factors like gold differences, champion selections, early-game objectives, and team compositions all play a role in determining whether a game ends quickly or stretches into the late stages.
In this project, we aim to analyze key variables and their impact on game length. By leveraging data from past matches, we will identify patterns and build predictive models to estimate how long a given game is likely to last. Understanding these correlations can provide strategic insights for players and enhance overall game analysis.
